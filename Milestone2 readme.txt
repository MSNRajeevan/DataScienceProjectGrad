Overview:


Milestone 2  focuses on various regression and classification analyses on our dataset. The dataset contains several variables, but our primary focus is on the Anxiety Score (GAD_T) as the dependent variable.


The notebook is properly organized into sections based on the questions asked in Milestone 2. The main sections in our notebook are:
1. Linear Regressions
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees and Random Forests


How to Run the Notebook:


1. Download the  Milestone2_code.ipynb file. 
2. Install necessary libraries: I’ll list down the libraries that you’d need to run the project file below.
3. Open the Milestone2_code.ipynb in Google Colab Notebook for easier access: or you can use jupyter to open the notebook.
4. How to use Google Colab:
