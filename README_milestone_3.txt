Overview: Milestone 3  focuses on SVMs, Neural Networks, Clustering applicability, feature selection, and comparative analysis of our research and dataset. The dataset contains several variables, but our primary focus is on the Anxiety Score (GAD_T) as the dependent variable.


How to Run the Python code: 

1. Download the  Milestone3_python_code.ipynb file. 
2. Install necessary libraries: I’ll list down the libraries that you’d need to run the project file below.
3. Open the Milestone3_python_code.ipynb in Google Colab Notebook for easier access: or you can use jupyter to open the notebook.
4. How to use Google Colab:
